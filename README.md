# Lab 1 for edap 30
This lab consists of two parts. In the first part, we will implement our own Gaussian process regressor and try to better understand how it works. In the second part, we will use pre-existing state-of-the-art libraries to use Bayesian Optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of a Machine Learning model.

### TODO:
- Go through the notebook and implement the requested code when asked to.
- Make sure that you understand and can answer all questions in the notebook.
- Peer review with another group.
- Present to a TA.


### Assignment:
Once you have finished and presented the lab to a TA, there is a corresponding individual report to write which is connected to this lab. The Assignment is not part of the lab and has a separate deadline. The assignment can be found in Canvas.
